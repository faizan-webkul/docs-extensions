# Installation

Follow the steps below to install the UnoPim Azure Blob Integration. Make sure you have terminal access to your server before getting started.

---

## Step 1 - Extract the Extension

Unzip the extension package you downloaded. Inside, you'll find a `packages` folder - merge it into the **root directory** of your UnoPim project. Your project structure should look like this:

```
/your-unopim-project
└── packages/
    └── Webkul/
        └── AzureBlob/
```

---

## Step 2 - Register the Service Provider

Open the `bootstrap/providers.php` file and add the following:

```php
use Webkul\AzureBlob\Providers\AzureBlobServiceProvider;

return [
    // ...existing providers...
    AzureBlobServiceProvider::class,
];
```

> [!NOTE]
> This registers the `AzureBlobServiceProvider` in the Laravel service container, allowing it to load routes, configurations, and services required by the Azure Blob integration.

---

## Step 3 - Update Composer Autoload

Open `composer.json` and add the following line under the `autoload > psr-4` section:

```json
"Webkul\\AzureBlob\\": "packages/Webkul/AzureBlob/src"
```

> [!TIP]
> This configures PSR-4 autoloading so PHP can automatically resolve classes under the `Webkul\AzureBlob` namespace from the package directory.

---

## Step 4 - Run the Setup Commands

Run the following commands one by one from your project root directory:

```bash
composer dump-autoload
php artisan azure-blob-package:install
php artisan optimize:clear
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `composer dump-autoload` | Regenerates Composer's autoloader mapping to include the newly added namespace. |
| `php artisan azure-blob-package:install` | Installs the Azure Blob SDK dependencies, runs database migrations, and publishes package assets. |
| `php artisan optimize:clear` | Clears all cached files (bootstrap, configuration, routes, and views) to load the new changes. |

---

## Verify the Installation

Once all commands have completed successfully, log in to your UnoPim dashboard. If the integration is installed correctly, you'll find the Azure Blob configuration options available in the admin settings.

If something doesn't look right, run `php artisan optimize:clear` again and refresh the page.

---

Next, you'll need to set up your Azure Blob Storage account and retrieve your credentials. Head over to [Azure Blob Storage Setup](./setup.md) to continue.
