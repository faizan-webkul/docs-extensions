# UnoPim - Import Products from ERPNext

Importing ERPNext **Items** into UnoPim as products.

## Overview

This import job pulls ERPNext **Item** records into UnoPim as products.

The job type is listed as **ERPNext: Item → Products**.

## Prerequisites

Before importing products, complete the following:

1. [Set up your ERPNext credentials](./setup-credentials.md).
2. (Recommended) Run the [Import Attributes](./import-attributes.md) and [Import Categories](./import-categories.md) jobs first, so the attributes and categories the products reference already exist in UnoPim.

## Re-running an Import

You can re-run a product import at any time. Sync mappings keep each product's identity across runs, so re-syncs **update** existing UnoPim products instead of creating duplicates. On conflicting updates, the connector uses a **last-write-wins** rule based on the `modified` timestamps on each side.
