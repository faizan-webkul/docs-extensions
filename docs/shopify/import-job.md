# Import Jobs

The UnoPim Shopify Connector works both ways. In addition to exporting products from UnoPim to Shopify, you can also **import data from Shopify back into UnoPim** — keeping both systems in sync.

To create an import job, go to **Data Transfer → Imports** and click **Create Import**.

> **Tip:** If you're setting up imports for the first time, run them in this order for best results: **Attributes → Categories → Family Variant Assignment → Products → Metafield Definitions**. This ensures all the supporting data is in place before products are imported.
