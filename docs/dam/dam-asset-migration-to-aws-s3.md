# DAM Asset Migration to AWS S3

If your **UnoPim DAM** assets are currently stored on the local private disk, you can migrate them to **Amazon S3** by using the dedicated Artisan command.

This helps when you want to:

- move existing DAM assets to cloud storage,
- keep new and old DAM files in the same S3 bucket,
- reduce storage pressure on your local server.

## Command Signature

Run:

```bash
php artisan unopim:dam:move-asset-to-s3
```

This command uploads DAM asset files from local private storage to the S3 bucket configured in your UnoPim AWS Integration settings.

## Prerequisites

Before running the command, make sure:

1. **UnoPim DAM** is installed and your assets are available locally.
2. **UnoPim AWS Integration** is installed and configured correctly.
3. Your S3 bucket, region, access key, and secret key are valid.
4. You have a working **admin account** for authentication.

If needed, complete the AWS setup first from the AWS Integration section.

## Admin Authentication

The command does not run anonymously.

When you start it, UnoPim will prompt you for:

- **email**
- **password**

Only valid **admin user credentials** can continue the DAM asset migration.

## Interactive Options

During execution, the command asks two important questions.

## Terminal Prompt Flow

This is the prompt sequence users will see when the command runs:

```bash
Enter your Email:
> admin@example.com

Enter your Password:
>

Want to migrate only new uploaded files from your local to s3 (yes/no):
>

Migrate New only flag: No

Want to delete files from local once uploaded to s3? (yes/no):
>

Delete flag: No
Starting migration to aws
10/10 [============================] 100%
Done Moving DAM Assets.
```

In this example:

- `Migrate New only flag: No` means the command is not limited to only newly uploaded files.
- `Delete flag: No` means the local DAM files will be kept after the upload finishes.

### 1. Migrate Only New Files?

If you choose **Yes**, the command migrates only DAM assets that are not already available on S3.

Use this option when:

- you already ran the command before,
- you only want to move recently uploaded DAM assets,
- you want a safer incremental migration.

If you choose **No**, the command checks the broader DAM asset set instead of limiting the run to newly uploaded files.

### 2. Delete Files from Local Disk After Upload?

If you choose **Yes**, local DAM files are deleted after they are uploaded successfully to Amazon S3.

Use this option only when:

- you have verified that the files are present on S3,
- asset preview and access are working correctly in UnoPim,
- you no longer need the local disk copy.

> [!CAUTION]
> On your first migration run, it is safer to keep local files until you finish verifying the DAM asset library on S3.

## Recommended First Run

For the first migration, this is the safest approach:

1. Run `php artisan unopim:dam:move-asset-to-s3`.
2. Sign in with a valid admin email and password.
3. Choose to migrate only new files if you want an incremental run.
4. Choose **not** to delete local files yet.
5. Open a few migrated assets in DAM and confirm they work correctly.
6. If everything looks correct, run the command again later and allow local cleanup if required.

## What to Verify After Migration

After the command completes, confirm that:

- the asset files exist in your S3 bucket,
- DAM assets still open correctly in UnoPim,
- linked product and category assets continue to work as expected,
- local files are removed only if you intentionally approved that option.
